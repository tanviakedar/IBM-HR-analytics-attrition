# IBM-HR-analytics-attrition
A data analysis project using IBMâ€™s fictional HR dataset to explore employee attrition and performance patterns. Includes EDA, feature analysis, attrition rate insights, and visualization using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Understand current employee attrition trends.
- Identify demographic and behavioral factors contributing to attrition.
- Analyze relationships between job satisfaction, work-life balance, compensation, and attrition.
- Support HR decision-making with data-driven insights and visualizations.



## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Excel** *(for exploratory views if needed)*
- **Dataset Source**: IBM (Fictional dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset))

- **Age**: Younger employees (25â€“35) have a higher attrition tendency.
- **OverTime**: Employees working overtime are more likely to leave.
- **Work-Life Balance**: Employees with poor balance show higher attrition.
- **Job Role Impact**: Certain roles like Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician have higher turnover.


## ðŸ“Œ Steps Performed

1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Visualizations to show attrition patterns  
4. Analysis of key metrics: income, satisfaction, performance  
5. Summary of findings and business recommendations
